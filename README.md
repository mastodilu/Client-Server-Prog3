# Client-Server-Prog3
A simple educational example of a client server email program using Java RMI

### Description
It is composed of 4 projects, one is the server and the other 3 are the clients.
Each client can send and receive emails from and to another client.
It works in local.

### How to use
I suggest to create 4 different projects using netbeans.
1. **server**<br>That folder goes directly into src of server project
2. **client1**, **client2** and **client3**<br>The content of client1 folder goes directly into src of the first client project, then do the same for the other clients which have their own projects and src folders.
    
**First run the server project, then run at least one client**. The client needs to find a working server at launch time.
If you open a client before the server you need to close and reopen it in order to make it work.
